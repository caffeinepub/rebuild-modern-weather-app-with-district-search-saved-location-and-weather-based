  "summary": "The diff implements a TR/EN i18n layer with Turkish default + localStorage persistence, adds a header language switcher, and updates major UI components to use translation keys including weather-condition descriptions via weather codes. Some additional, non-requested styling/utility changes were also introduced.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Global styling and Tailwind theme/token changes unrelated to bilingual i18n requirements (e.g., OKLCH tokens, contrast/readability adjustments).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on i18n, language toggle, persistence, and translation coverage; it does not request global redesign or color/token system changes.",

      "description": "Added a weather-contrast helper utility not mentioned in the i18n-focused requirements.",
      "reason": "REQ-10..REQ-13 do not request new contrast utilities; this appears to be extra functionality beyond translation/toggling/persistence.",

      "description": "Introduced/maintained an empty hook file described as unused backend actor integration.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not ask to add new placeholder/empty hooks; this is unrelated to i18n and could be considered extraneous.",
