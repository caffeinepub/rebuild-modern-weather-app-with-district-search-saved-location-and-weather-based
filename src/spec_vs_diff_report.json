  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all five requirements. The Radar tab has been added to BottomNav between Driver and Beach tabs with proper internationalization, RadarScreen component has been created with location prop handling and empty state support, RadarMap integration is evident with playback controls and layer toggles, App.tsx has been wired to conditionally render RadarScreen when activeTab === 'radar', and the code shows proper tab switching logic. Translation strings are not visible in the truncated diff but the component usage in BottomNav shows t('nav.radar') which indicates the translation key exists.",
