  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented via updated global `.glass-surface` utilities (alpha 0.3) and by switching `LaundryDryingRecommendation` to use `glass-surface`. REQ-3 is only partially evidenced (updates shown for Driver/Farmer/Radar empty/loading states), with no concrete diff evidence for other major panels (e.g., Weather main panels, Beach tab, header/footer). The diff summary file also indicates additional unrequested UI/theming changes (including to `BackgroundIllustration`), which may violate constraints.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Verify and enforce that all other major window/panel surfaces across all tabs (Weather, Farmer, Driver, Radar, Beach, and empty states) use the global glass utilities (or otherwise match the 30% opaque / 70% transparent ratio) so the transparency is consistent app-wide.",
      "reason": "Only some surfaces are explicitly shown updated to `glass-surface` (Driver/Farmer cards; Radar empty/loading containers). There is no direct diff evidence that other major panels across Weather/Beach tabs and other prominent app surfaces have been audited/updated to the new 0.3 alpha ratio.",
