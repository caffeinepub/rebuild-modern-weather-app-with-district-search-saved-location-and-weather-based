/**
 * React Query hooks for backend operations.
 * 
 * This file manages all data fetching and state invalidation.
 * Currently, the backend is not used; all data is fetched client-side from:
 * - Open-Meteo Weather API (weather forecasts)
 * - Open-Meteo Marine API (marine/beach conditions)
 * - Open-Meteo Air Quality API (air quality data)
 * - RainViewer API (radar data)
 */

// This file is intentionally empty as all queries are implemented
// in feature-specific hooks (useWeather, useMarineConditions, useRainViewer, etc.)
